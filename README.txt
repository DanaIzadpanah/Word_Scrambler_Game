Description: This document provides instructions on running two variations of a coding challenge I undertook: the "NON-REACT PROJ" and the "REACT PROJ".

Available Projects:
NON-REACT PROJ: Utilizes HTML, CSS, Node JS, and JavaScript. The associated branch for this version is "pure-js".
REACT PROJ: Incorporates React and Node JS. This is located in the "main" branch.
Detailed steps are provided below to set up and run each project. If you are already familiar with certain steps, you may skip them; however, I've ensured that each step is thorough to prevent potential issues.

How to Run the REACT PROJ:
Clone the Repository:

    - git clone [repository-url]
Set up the Backend:

    - cd [path-to-backend-folder]
    - node index.js
    
Your backend server should now be running locally.

Set up the Frontend:

    - cd [path-to-frontend-folder]
    - npm run dev

If this doesn't work:

    - rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    - npm install
    - npm run dev

Access the Application: Once running, copy the provided server URL and paste it into your browser to view the application.

How to Run the NON-REACT PROJ:
Clone the Repository:

    - git clone [repository-url] -b pure-js

Set up the Backend:

    - cd [path-to-backend-folder]
    - node index.js

Your backend server should now be running locally.

Set up the Frontend: Navigate to the frontend folder, open index.html using VSCode, right-click and select "Open with live server".

Access the Application: Once running, copy the provided server URL and paste it into your browser to view the application.

Feedback:
I thoroughly enjoyed this project; it was an exhilarating experience working with React to develop a game. Kudos to the team for the effort in assembling this. A suggestion for future iterations: combining frontend and backend sessions, or sharing pre-existing code earlier would be beneficial. It would allow us more time to familiarize ourselves with the technologies and ensure timely completion. Nevertheless, it was a fantastic learning experience! Thank you.
